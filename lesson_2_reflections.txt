What happens when you initialize a repository? Why 
do you need to do it?

Git starts tracking files in that directory. I need 
to do this for every project I want to track using 
git. 

=====================================================

How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository? What value do you think 
it offers?

Staging area can have some of the files of the working
directory, that are related to a particular commit.

After the staged files are commited they are part of the 
Repository. Having staging area gives us the freedom
of adding more modular commits. We can make changes to
10 files and make multiple logical commits of those 10
files. For example 3 files may relate to a commit and 
the other 7 may relate to another logical commit.
